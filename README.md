# Foreword
This was one of the first if not the first repository I created on github, none of these is are fully coded by me. All I did was change the background and the color scheme of these themes, and I thought that made me a "real coder" back then lmao. Most of these are pretty bad, the color scheme is pretty bad become some links and parts of the discord ui blend in with the background. 

Some of the themes are based off of NotAnotherAnimeTheme by puckzxz (https://github.com/puckzxz/NotAnotherAnimeTheme)
Some of them use BasicBackground by DevilBro (https://betterdiscord.app/theme/BasicBackground)
And some of them also use ServerColumns also from DevilBro (https://betterdiscord.app/theme/ServerColumns)

I don't recommend you to use my themes, there are tons better themes that are a lot better than mine, and if you want a custom one just use a theme builder like this one, https://www.limeshark.dev/editor

Anyways, thanks for checking out this repository :)
